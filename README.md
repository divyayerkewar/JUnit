# JUnit
This Repository contains my JUnit assignment, where i have documented my learnings on JUnit assertions and annotations

## JUnit EXamples:
## Annotations  
@Test - This Annotation marks a method as a test method
@BeforeEach- Before Annotation run before each test for setup
@AfterEach - After Annotation run After each test for reset
@BeforeAll- BeforeAll Annotation run once Before all tests for setup
@AfterAll- AfterAll annotation run once After all tests for reset

### Assertions
assertEquals : checks if the two values are equal
assertNotEquals : checks if two values are not equal
assertTrue - checks the condition is true
assertFalse -  checks the condition is false
assertNull - check an object is null
assertNotNull - checks an object is not null
assertArrayEquals - check the two arrays are equal
